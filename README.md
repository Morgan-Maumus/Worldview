Before you run, please ensure you are using python 3.10 and have installed dependencies in requirements.txt

There are environment variables for the OpenAI API Key & the Cohere API Key. I've provided the keys in the project report to keep it private from GitHub. You can either replace the variable name within llm.ipynb in cell 8 with the keys in the report, make sure to put them inside quotation marks. Otherwise, you can create a new file named .env, copy the code with the API keys, and paste within the .env file.
